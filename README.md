# DesignedIrish
Resume website of Sascha Andeweg - Designed.Irish
Built to arouse the interest of recruiters and employers to hire me as a
graphic designer, full stack webdeveloper or a combination of the two.
There's also the possibility to enquire about doing freelance projects.

## UX
The site is meant to arouse the interest of recruiters and/or employers or anyone wanting a project done
so the information has to be very clear, easy to find and to the point. The site has to show Sascha's abilities,
style and personality.

### User stories

1 _Employer_

2 _Recruiter_

3 _Client for freelance project_

  * 1 An _employer_ is looking for someone to strengthen the team and wants to make a selection after receiving applications.
  Sascha's application refers to his resume site so the potential employer wants to get an impression of how Sascha's work is presented,
  how able Sascha is as a designer, what technologies are used, what has he accomplished in the past, is he still educating himself and how able is he doing so.
  All the information is found on one scrollable page and imagery and text shows that he's able to present all the desired material where you'd expect it to be.
  Navigation follows the conventions and gives one the choice to either scroll or use the navigation bar.
  The user is invited to get in touch with an email form and the footer gives one the opportunity to download a digital CV file in PDF format.
  The site makes it very clear that Sascha has years of experience in the printing industry as a graphic designer. Having worked on webdesign before and now
  being trained as a full stack webdeveloper can be very valuable within a small team and is definetely a bonus to some employers. Having worked within the
  same company for almost 28 years shows loyalty and still working on websites for Dutch customers shows that he's able to keep loyal clients happy.

  * 2 A _recruiter_ is looking for potential employees to serve a large tech client. Sascha's resume site shows up on his LinkedIn profile and the recruiter
  decides to have a quick look. The colourful and different style of the imagery grabs his attention. The very brief text explaining that this is someone
  from The Netherlands now living in Ireland makes him stand out a little bit more. The combination of printing and a total switch to machine learning and artificial
  intelligence is remarkable and now being trained to possibly tie all this experience together. The recruiter decides to at least download the PDF with Sascha's
  CV and make a note of his skillset and location in Cork, the booming 'real capital'.

  * 3 A small, promising, new business needs a website and decides to look for a small agency or a freelancer that is able to create a bespoke website for their 
  business that is not your every day type of business. They are located in the north Cork region so they'd prefer to find someone local. Sascha's site shows up and it becomes 
  clear that his broad experience could be very usefull to their business. The pictures on Sascha's site - that turn out to be his own work - tell a thousand words or
  more and draw attention to the very brief but clear message. It looks like Sascha could bring across the companies message and information in a very effective, attractive and
  clear manner. The founder of the company fills in the simple form asking Sascha to get in touch asap.

### Testing:
Testing of the website is done physically on Windows 10 desktop, tablet and laptop, Android tablet and phone, iPad iOS, iPhone and MacBook Pro.
The tested browsers were Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Samsung for Android tablet, Safari.
The following was tested:

1 *Responsiveness:* Do the columns appear or disappear resizing the screen or rotating. Do images resize as intended and does all text stay readable and visible.

2 *Navigation:* Do all the buttons in the navigation link to the appropriate anchors and does the back and forward function of the browser keep working for the user.

3 *Links:* Are all the hyperlinks assigned and functional and do they link to the appropriate file, hyperlink, anchor or website and do blank pages open where needed.

4 *Form:* Does the form warn when fields are blank before sending. The return page after sending will be added in a next stage, but no error messages will alarm the user.

5 *Scroll effect:* Does the site show a smooth scrolling effect when using the navigation bar. Safari and Edge are known to need some JavaScript code to achieve this effect. This will be implemented in a later stage.
